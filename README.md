## Description
Android boilerplate project to create new Android projects from. It provides basic architecture, tools and guidelines that we use when developing Android apps.

## Getting started
First clone the boilerplate repository. Next, if you want to copy the boilerplate into your own repository follow _Clone into your own repository_.
If you just want to get started with customising things for your own project skip onto _Make it your own_.

### Clone into your own repository
Follow these steps if you have a repository with a branch you'd like to copy the boilerplate project into:
```
$ cd <path to boilerplate>
$ git remote add newrepo <path to newrepo>
$ git checkout --orphan copy
$ git commit -m "Copying boilerplate"
$ git push newrepo copy:<branch on new repo>
```
This will copy the boilerplate project without history to your own branch in your repository.

### Make it your own
Personalise the boilerplate for your own project:
1. Rename `com.ustwo.boilerplate` packages to your own domain's stucture. E.g `com.mydomain.myapp`.
    See [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29092698) for a steps to easily accomplish this in Android Studio.

2. Open `app/build.gradle` and change the following to match your new package names:
    * `applicationId "com.mydomain.myapp"`
    * `testInstrumentationRunner "com.mydomain.myapp.application.ApplicationTestRunner"`



## Modules
This project consists of the following modules:

- app, Phone & tablet module

## Tools
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), Provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), An open source build automation system.

## Testing and CI

### Circle
By default this boilerplate comes configured to run on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com). The YML file `circle.yml` will setup the dependencies, run the tests configured in `scripts/ci.sh` and export relevant reports and artefacts.

If you have configured the environment variables defined in the "Firebase cloud testing" the tests will be run on the [Firebase test lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/) otherwise your tests will be run on an emulator.

### Firebase cloud testing
This boilerplate ships with Firebase cloud testing built in. You simply need to enter the following environment variables to make it work:

- `GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - The service account email address is listed in the Firebase console here: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectId>/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk`
- `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY` - This is an export of the contents of the JSON secret file that can be obtained by generating a new private key here: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectId>/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk`
- `GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - This is a unique identifier for your Firebase project which can be found in this project's URL: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectId>`

The cloud testing setup by default will run your instrumentation tests, take screenshots and save the test report and artefacts.

## Signing and secrets
The repository contains two files responsible for secrets and signing; `ci-keys.cipher` and `release.keystore.cipher` respectivly. Both files have been encrypted using openssl aes-256-cbc with the key `ustwoopensource`. These files are intended solely as placeholders to allow you to make release builds and **need** to be replaced before releasing to the app store.

The current secret management implementation is simple when you have a small number of secrets or files that need encrypting and / or a small team. If you are working on a large project where access to secrets and files should be more carefully managed then we recommend using [BlackBox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) by StackExchange.

### Editing secrets
To add, view or edit secrets you first need to decrypt them using openssl:
```
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -out ci-keys -in ci-keys.cipher -k ustwoopensource
```

This will creat a file called `ci-keys` which you can then edit as needed and encrypt again using:
```
openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in ci-keys -out ci-keys.cipher -k ustwoopensource
```

The file `ci-keys.cipher` will then be ready to commit.

The same process can be used with `release.keystore.cipher` when you need to replace or change the keystore with your own details.

### CI setup
For the secrets and keystore to be used by your CI server you will need to export the environment variable `CI_SECRETS_KEY` with the default key listed above or your own if you've re-encrypted the secrets and keystore yourself. You will also need to ensure that openssl is added as a dependency / installed by default.
